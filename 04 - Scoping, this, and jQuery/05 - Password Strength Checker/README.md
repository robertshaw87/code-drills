# Password Strength Checker #

### We're going to be creating a validation function for checking the strength of a password. The important part of this activity is the logic behind the checker, so you are given the html and the rest of the javascript. You should not have to modify any part of the code given to you. Just work within the area allotted to you to fulfill the objectives. ###

* Password strengths are as follows:
    * A very weak password has equal to or fewer than 6 characters and consists only of numbers
    * A weak password has equal to or fewer than 6 characters and consists only of letters
    * A strong password has more than 6 characters and consists of at least one number and at least one letter
    * A very strong password has more than 6 characters and consists of at least one number, at least one letter, and at least one special character
    * Anything other type of password is of average strength

* Your password strength checker function should only return one output per password given

* Your function should return the greatest strength level that the password satisfied from weak all the way up to strong with average being in the middle of the two.
